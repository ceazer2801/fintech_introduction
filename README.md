# fintech_introduction
A quick introduction and description of my Fintech goals.

My name is Christian D. Cathro, I am a commercial ventilation expert by day and a husband/father/crypto enthusiast by night.  I have tought myself how to code over the year thruough lots and lots and lots of web searching.

My career goals are ever shifting, being with the same company for 17 years I was always on a path, however with the recent emergence of the FinTech sector and I see my passion leading me in new and esciting directions

I have always had a very 'logical' approach to live and have always had a huge passion for building and technology.  Once i learned about cryptos I was instantly hooked with no looking back!
